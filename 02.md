hey
Don't use spaces in your file name
Shortcut for render: F1

# Turn off page number ```\pagestyle{empty}```
put it after \documentclass and before \begin

# Superscripts ```2x^{3x+1}```
if there's only character to be superscripted(like 2x^{3})\\
you can remove {}

# Subsctipts ```$$x_{12}$$```
- Why does x_1_2 give an error?
  Becuase it's not clear to the Tex what we mean, is it "x sub 1, sub 2" or "x sub, 1 sub 2"?
  
Best practice: start putting curly bracket '{}' from the very right pair of numbers:
e.g:
```$$x_{1_{2_3}}$$```

Q: What's the differenec between these two:
1- ```$$x_{{1}_{2}}$$``` x sub, 1 sub 2
2- ```$${x_{1}}_{2}$$``` x sub 1, sub 2

# Lower dots ```\ldots```
```$a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{100}$```

# Greek letters
Lower case pi: ```$$\pi$$```
Upper case pi: ```$$\Pi$$```
Area of a circle: ```$$A=\pi r^2$$```


#Trig functions
* Wrong way:
```$$y=sin x$$```
* Right way: 
```$$y=\sin x$$```
```$$y=\csc \theta$$```
```$$y=\sin^{-1} x$$```
```$$y=\arcsin x$$```

# Log functions 
Wrong:
```$$y=logx$$```
Right:
```$$y=\log_5 x$$```
```$$y=\ln x$$```

# Roots
```$$\sqrt{2}$$
$$\sqrt[3]{2}$$
$$\sqrt[2]{y+2}$$
$$\sqrt{\sqrt{1-x}} = \sqrt[4]{1-x}$$
```

# Fractions
```$$\frac{1}{x}$$```

```About $\frac{2}{3}$ of the glass is full.```

# Show in displayed Math Mode ```\displaystyle```
Sometimes the fraction gets smaller when it's in a sentence,\\
this way, we can increase its size

About $\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}$ of the glass is full.

# Displayed Fraction ```\dfrac{}{}```
requires one of these packages, which one? idk.
```\usepackge{amsmath}{amssymb}{amsfonts}```

# Change the spacing between 2 lines ```\\[6pt]```
After putting \\ to break the line, put [number unit] to set the spacing


# Tip
write your brackets with a lot of spaces so that you can distinguish among elements that are in there
```$\frac{1}{   1+\frac{1}{x}     }$```
